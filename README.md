# CSGO.GO Client

## About

This is a light-weight CSGO hack client made in GoLang that adds some features like wallhack, aimbot and triggerbot for study purposes only.

As I said, this is for study purposes only, and I don't recommend to use this on your main account or any account that you cares. If you get banned, this is not my responsability. Counter-Strike Global Offensive have cleary terms that rejects any type of cheating in online matches and it should be respected.

This client don't have any relations to Valve or similar, and use this on online matches isn't allowed officially by Valve.
